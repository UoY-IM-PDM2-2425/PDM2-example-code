# practical-template
Includes the p5.js and p5.sound.js libraries and basic file structure for practicals. Duplicate the exercise folder and update for each individual exercise.

Instructions are embedded in each exercise HTML file and optionally include images or videos of expected output and extra hints. Remove anything that's not used.

The jsconfig.json file enables code completion hints in sketch.js. p5.js and p5.sound.js are in the lib/libraries folder. main-styles.css contains basic CSS styling for the HTML pages and can be safely removed if not needed. preload.js and test-utils.js are related to unit testing so can be removed if there will not be unit testing.
